PHASE 2:
    - Print as many semantic errors as possible
    - Nested scopes


    1. Build IR tree (symbol table) by recursing through AST
    2. Pass IR tree into checker and do semantic checks



// Example descriptor
Class Function(IrNode):
    name: str
    scope: "Scope",
    params,
    return_type,
    body: "block",
    span: Span

class Span:
    start: Position
    end: Position
