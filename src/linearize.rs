/*
Linearize the Parse Tree to create a linear 
IR that can be used for code generation.

The linear IR is an ordered vector of instructions,
which follow similarly to the three-address code format.

***NOTE***: We are currently skipping linearizing the IR,
and just doing CFG as the first stage of codegen.
